subtitle: How to encrypt the contents of a git repo with git-crypt.
---

I have a private GitHub repository that I keep all my config files in.
Realistically, a private GitHub repo is probably enough for personal security
and I could commit secret things configs into this repo
unencrypted. But if you don't want to trust GitHub with your secret data, or if
you want to push your config files to a bare repo hosted somewhere less private and secure, or check them out somewhere insecure, then
it'd be a good idea to encrypt any secret data before committing it to git.

[git-crypt](https://www.agwa.name/projects/git-crypt/) is a git extension that
can transparently encrypt files before they get committed to git, and decrypt
them after they get checked out from git. You tell it which files to encrypt
using `.gitattributes` files, so you can mix encrypted and unencrypted files
in the same git repo. It will even store encrypted diffs when you change
encrypted files, so you can still see line-by-line diffs of encrypted content
with `git log -p`.

To install git-crypt on Ubuntu 15.10+ just do `sudo apt-get install git-crypt`,
on Ubuntu < 15.10 you have to install it from source:

```shell
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential libssl-dev
git clone https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt.git
cd git-crypt
make
sudo make install
```

To enable git-crypt on a git repo cd into the repo, init git crypt, and add
your GPG key:

```shell
git crypt init
git crypt add-gpg-user <KEY ID>
```

(To get your GPG key ID run `gpg --list-keys`, you can add as many GPG keys
as you want this way if you want to share the encrypted contents with others.)

After git cloning a repo with git-crypt files in it you need to decrypt it
by running:

```shell
git crypt unlock
```

From now on git-crypt will transparently encrypt and decrypt files for you when
you commit and check them out as normal.

You now need to add `.gitattributes` files to tell git-crypt which files to
encrypt. It's easy to accidentally commit unencrypted files that you thought
were going to be encrypted, by having them not match `.gitattributes` globs
that you thought they would match. For that reason it's best to use the
top-level `.gitattributes` file to encrypt top-level files only, and give any
subdirs with encrypted files their own `.gitattributes` files. Here's my
top-level `.gitattributes` file that encrypts my `_msmtprc` and `_transifexrc`
files, as well as all `_mutt.password.*` and `_offlineimap.passwords.*` files:

    _msmtprc filter=git-crypt diff=git-crypt
    _mutt.password.* filter=git-crypt diff=git-crypt
    _offlineimap.passwords.* filter=git-crypt diff=git-crypt
    _transifexrc filter=git-crypt diff=git-crypt

And here's my `secret/.gitattributes` file that encrypts everything in the
`secret` subdir using `*`:

    * filter=git-crypt diff=git-crypt
    .git* !filter !diff
    README !filter !diff

Notice the additional rules to prevent files like `.gitignore` and the
`.gitattributes` files, and any `README` file, from being encrypted. You can
copy this `.gitattributes` file into any directory that should be encrypted.

Make sure you **commit the .gitattributes files into the git repo**.

Before committing secret files, run `git crypt status` to check which files
are encrypted and which aren't. You can get a list of all files that will be
encrypted before commit with:

```shell
git crypt status | ack '    encrypted'
```

Or list the encrypted or unencrypted status of all files in the `_ssh` directory
with:

```shell
git crypt status | ack '_ssh'
```

You want to check for both files that should be encrypted but aren't, and also
files that should not be encrypted but are (including `.gitattributes` and
`.gitignore` files in encrypted subdirectories - these should not be encrypted).


## Purging unencrypted sensitive content

If you accidentally commit some unencrypted sensitive content that should have
been encrypted, it's not enough to just roll back the branch as the commit will
still be in your `.git` directory (and will still propagate into the `.git`
directories of any clones).

You can use [BFG Repo-Cleaner](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/) to
clean out sensitive content. To install it:

```shell
sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jre
wget 'http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/madgag/bfg/1.12.5/bfg-1.12.5.jar'
```

It's a good idea to backup your repo before using BFG on it, in case you
accidentally delete something you didn't want to:

```shell
git clone --mirror /path/to/your/repo /path/to/your/repo.backup
```

Then, for example to purge the `_ssh` directory:

```shell
java -jar bfg-1.12.5.jar --delete-folders '_ssh' .git
git reflog expire --expire=now --all
git gc --prune=now --aggressive
```
