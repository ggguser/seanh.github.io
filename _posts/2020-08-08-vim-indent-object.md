Operate on an Indented Block of Lines with vim-indent-object
============================================================

[vim-indent-object](https://github.com/michaeljsmith/vim-indent-object) is a great Vim plugin that adds an `i` text object for an indented block of text,
very useful in Python!

* <kbd>vii</kbd> selects all lines at the same indentation level as the current line.

  For example just the body of a method and _not_ the method signature or any empty lines below the method.
  Or just the body of a `try` clause and _not_ the `try` line itself.
  
* <kbd>vai</kbd> selects all lines at the same indentation level as the current line,
  _and_ the first unindented line above the indented block (e.g. the method
  signature, if the indented block is a method, or the `try` if the indented
  block is a try clause, etc).
  
  This also selects any blank lines below the indented block, if it's followed
  directly by empty lines.

* <kbd>vaI</kbd> selects an indentation level and both the unindented line above _and_ the unindented line below it.

  For a method this will select the method's signature (unindented line above) _and_ the signature of the next method
  below (unindented line below) (as well as any empty lines between the two methods).
  
  For a `try` clause it'll select both the `try` above and the first `except` below (but not the body of the `except` clause).

* In visual mode you can keep repeating one of the above mappings to keep selecting more and more text at higher and higher indentation levels.
For example:

  <kbd>vii</kbd> (goes into visual mode and selects the body of a try clause),
  <kbd>ii</kbd> (widens the selection to the entire method),
  <kbd>ii</kbd> (widens the selection again, to the entire class body),
  <kbd>ii</kbd> (widens the selection to also include the `class` signature).
  After this, further <kbd>ii</kbd>'s start selecting lines and blocks above the class.

You can combine the `ai`, `ii` and `aI` text objects with other operators besides `v` for visual mode,
e.g. <kbd>cii</kbd>, <kbd>dii</kbd>, <kbd>yii</kbd> etc.
For example <kbd>>ii</kbd> or <kbd><ii</kbd> will indent or dedent an indented block.
If you have [vim-commentary](https://github.com/tpope/vim-commentary) installed then
<kbd>gcii</kbd> will comment out an indented block.
